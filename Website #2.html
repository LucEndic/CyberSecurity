<p> If you came here from my previous webpage and were expecting a myspace, you failed! This is a technique that hackers may use to steal your information, next time when you hover over a link, look in the bottom left corner and read the URL. Try it here with this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvOjGkfea_w&list=LL&index=62&ab_channel=AcousticTrench"> Link</a>, where does it lead? </p>
<p style="background-color:violet;"> <b> Heres another test, pick out the fake virus attack from below! </b>

<p> That last example was a fake one! But when you give people who work all day the ability to name attacks, you may end up with really <span style="font-family:brush script MT;"> goofy</span> names. </p>
<p> While the main examples of cyberattacks used may be from many years ago, cyberattacks are still an ongoing and worrying problem for today. Just this year there were <b>major</b> attacks on pharmacies through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware;">ransomware<a> with hackers working for a group named <i>BlackCat</i>. Look below for a video I found on youtube and did not watch myself: </p>

<p> The below video is one I also found on youtube.This video has been injected by malware into your computer to play whenever you start it up. I hope you enjoyed clicking on these links. </p>

<p>I did not infect your computer (as you may have known due to not actually downloading anything), and I sincerly hope you had an enjoyable time looking through all of this. Please enjoy below where I make an attempt to meet the project requirements while also attempting to look like a Myspace Profile. </p>
